        "Explanation": "Option A : “All of the physical security and most of the data/network security are taken care of for you” that’s right but you also have to worry about a lot of things to be secure like setting up the IAMs and creating the MFA and so on. (please read about the shared responsibility model). Option E is not correct as we mentioned. Option B is not correct as the Physical infrastructure is a responsibility of AWS and not the customer. Hence it is not an advantage of moving to the AWS Cloud. Option C is correct: “In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower”. Option D is correct in AWS there is no upfront costs as it follows the “ pay as you go “ model.",

            "Explanation": "There are 3 Cloud Computing Models: 1) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today. 2) Platform as a Service (PaaS) - Platform as a Service (PaaS) removes the need for your organization to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application. 3) Software as a Service (SaaS) - Software as a Service (SaaS) provides you with a completed product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email which you can use to send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to the email product or maintain the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on.

For customers who specifically need to replicate their data or applications over greater geographic distances, there are AWS Local Regions. An AWS Local Region is a single datacenter designed to complement an existing AWS Region. Like all AWS Regions, AWS Local Regions are completely isolated from other AWS Regions.
